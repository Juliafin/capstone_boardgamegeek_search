#BoardgameGeek Api Feedback

I spoke with several people on slack, who liked the boardgameGeek api app. They suggested that I change the following:

-brighter colors
-search box bigger and overlayed on main photo
-Images bigger
-Float images left and right
-No rounded corners    
-More space between elements and heading
-Change instructions text case
-Keep user in task space
-Change text to :" Find stats and video walkthroughs for any board game"
-Minimizing scroll (or add arrow)
-Additional responsiveness
-Match Title texts with window text

I have worked through and implemented these changes as much as possible.
